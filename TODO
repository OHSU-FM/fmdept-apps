Subject: FW: leave request for Patrice Eiff has been accepted

Pema and Bill – I tried to write note back to the employee but it said I 
don’t have rights to submit.  Can I get rights so that I can communicate 
within the system as to why I am rejecting or asking for more info?

Muchas Gracias!  BK
